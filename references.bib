	abstract = {Recently, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) revised their recreational water quality criteria, in which adjustments were made by approving enterococci (ENT) quantitative PCR (qPCR) as an alternative, rapid method and advocating the use of predictive models for water quality management. The implementation of qPCR-based methods and prediction models are meant to decrease the time between sample collection and public advisories and notifications. To date, few studies have compared qPCR-based models to culture-based prediction models and none of these studies have been conducted in coastal estuarine systems. In this study, we created prediction models using qPCR-based fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) data in dual-use recreational and shellfish harvesting waters and compared them to published ENT and Escherichia coli (EC) culture-based prediction models in eastern North Carolina estuaries. Furthermore, an empirical statistical model was created to predict qPCR inhibition levels so that proper remediation techniques can be applied when it is a problem. Predictor variable selection in both qPCR- and culture-based ENT models was very similar; both models included 14-day rain total, dissolved oxygen, and salinity/conductivity, with 89 and 90\% of qPCR and culture data described, respectively. Using ENT management action thresholds, qPCR- and culture-based models showed high accuracy in management decisions. The qPCR model had 92 and 96\% accuracy using the 110 and 1000 cell equivalents (CE)/100 ml thresholds, respectively, and the culture model had 90\% accuracy in management decisions with the 110 MPN/100 ml threshold. EC models for qPCR- and culture-based concentrations used similar independent variables (14-day humidity, salinity/conductivity, a rain/storm variable, and a measure of air temperature), with each model explaining 26 and 55\% of the data variation, respectively. When using different thresholds that were logs apart for management decisions, the two EC models accurately predicted management decisions; qPCR models correctly predicted management decisions 96 and 77\% of the time (using 31 and 320 CE/100 ml, respectively) while culture models correctly predicted management decisions 96 and 88\% percent of the time (with 31 and 320 MPN/100 ml, respectively). Equivalency between models was shown in our non-point source impacted estuaries, with ENT models performing slightly better than EC models. In addition, inhibition of the qPCR was a major issue that had to be addressed. An inhibition model was created with easily obtained meteorological data and accounted for a high level of data variability (adjusted R2 = 0.82).},

	abstract = {Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) measurement of enterococci has been proposed as a rapid technique for assessment of beach water quality, but the response of qPCR results to environmental conditions has not been fully explored. Culture-based E. coli and enterococci have been used in empirical predictive models to characterize their responses to environmental conditions and to increase monitoring frequency and efficiency. This approach has been attempted with qPCR results only in few studies. During the summer of 2006, water samples were collected from two southern Lake Michigan beaches and the nearby river outfall (Burns Ditch) and were analyzed for enterococci by culture-based and non-culture-based (i.e., qPCR) methods, as well as culture-based E. coli. Culturable enterococci densities (log CFU/100 ml) for the beaches were significantly correlated with enterococci qPCR cell equivalents (CE) (R = 0.650, P \&lt; 0.0001, N = 32). Enterococci CE and CFU densities were highest in Burns Ditch relative to the beach sites; however, only CFUs were significantly higher (P \&lt; 0.0001). Culturable enterococci densities at Burns Ditch and the beaches were significantly correlated (R = 0.565, P \&lt; 0.0001, N = 32). Culturable E. coli and enterococci densities were significantly correlated (R = 0.682, P \&lt; 0.0001, N = 32). Regression analyses suggested that enterococci CFU could be predicted by lake turbidity, Burns Ditch discharge, and wind direction (adjusted R2 = 0.608); enterococci CE was best predicted by Burns Ditch discharge and log-transformed lake turbidity × wave height (adjusted R2 = 0.40). In summary, our results show that analytically, the qPCR method compares well to the non-culture-based method for measuring enterococci densities in beach water and that both these approaches can be predicted by hydrometeorological conditions. Selected predictors and model results highlight the differences between the environmental responses of the two method endpoints and the potentially high variance in qPCR results.},

	abstract = {Efforts to improve public health protection in recreational swimming waters have focused on obtaining real-time estimates of water quality. Current monitoring techniques rely on the time-intensive culturing of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) from water samples, but rapidly changing FIB concentrations result in management errors that lead to the public being exposed to high FIB concentrations (type II error) or beaches being closed despite acceptable water quality (type I error). Empirical predictive models may provide a rapid solution, but their effectiveness at improving health protection has not been adequately assessed. We sought to determine if emerging monitoring approaches could effectively reduce risk of illness exposure by minimizing management errors. We examined four monitoring approaches (inactive, current protocol, a single predictive model for all beaches, and individual models for each beach) with increasing refinement at 14 Chicago beaches using historical monitoring and hydrometeorological data and compared management outcomes using different standards for decision-making. Predictability (R2) of FIB concentration improved with model refinement at all beaches but one. Predictive models did not always reduce the number of management errors and therefore the overall illness burden. Use of a Chicago-specific single-sample standard—rather than the default 235 E. coli CFU/100 ml widely used—together with predictive modeling resulted in the greatest number of open beach days without any increase in public health risk. These results emphasize that emerging monitoring approaches such as empirical models are not equally applicable at all beaches, and combining monitoring approaches may expand beach access.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of E. coli in recreational beach water are highly variable both locally and temporally, but a broader understanding of these fluctuations may be explained through coastal observations. Currently, beach contamination study approaches tend to be site-specific under the belief that politically delineated beaches are unique and management of beaches cannot be regionally oriented. E. coli data collected over five years from 23 Chicago beaches clearly identified ambient linked patterns at the regional scale. Temporal fluctuations were similar, with all beaches having simultaneous peaks and troughs of E. coli concentrations. Spatially, E. coli concentrations for beaches more closely situated were more closely correlated, indicating spatial autocorrelation. Julian day, wave height, and barometric pressure explained up to 40\% of the variation, a value comparable to individual, less parsimonious site-specific models. Day of sampling could explain the majority of the variation in E. coli concentrations, more so than beach, depth, or time of day. Comparing beaches along a targeted coastline allows a better understanding of inherent background regional fluctuations and, ultimately, better predictions of E. coli concentrations in coastal recreational water.},

	abstract = {Methods are needed improve the timeliness and accuracy of recreational water‐quality assessments. Traditional culture methods require 18–24 h to obtain results and may not reflect current conditions. Predictive models, based on environmental and water quality variables, have been used to estimate water quality, but their effectiveness has not been well studied in inland recreational waters. Results from sampling over three recreational seasons from eight inland recreational lakes in Ohio were used to investigate the use of predictive models for E. coli and the links between E. coli concentrations, environmental and water‐quality variables, and pathogens. Based upon sampling results from 21 beaches, models were developed for 13 inland lake beaches, and the most predictive variables were rainfall, wind direction and speed, turbidity, and water temperature. Models were validated at nine beaches during an independent year. At three of the nine beaches, the use of a model resulted in an increase in correct responses, sensitivities, and specificities as compared to using the previous day’s E. coli concentration (the current method). At one beach, model performance was not improved over that of the current method and, at the remaining five beaches, there were too few exceedances during the validation year to adequately assess model performance. At five sites, a subset of samples were analyzed for bacterial,protozoan, and viral pathogens. Cryptosporidium, adenovirus, eaeA‐E. coli, ipaH‐Shigella, and spVC‐Salmonella were found in at least 20\% of samples collected for pathogens. The presence orabsence of the three bacterial genes were related to some of the model variables, but were notconsistently related to E. coli concentrations. This study evaluates if predictive models can be used to provide real-time assessment at inland lakes.},

Recently, research efforts have been directed towards the identification of potential sources of fecal contamination impacting waterways and beaches. This is often referred to as microbial source tracking. However, recent studies have reported that E. coli can become "naturalized" to soil, sand, sediments, and algae in tropical, subtropical, and temperate environments. This phenomenon raises issues concerning the continued use of this bacterium as an indicator of fecal contamination. In this review, we discuss the relationship between E. coli and fecal pollution and the use of this bacterium as an indicator of fecal contamination in freshwater systems. We also discuss recent studies showing that E. coli can become an active member of natural microbial communities in the environment, and how this bacterium is being used for microbial source tracking. We also discuss the impact of environmentally-"naturalized" E. coli populations on water quality.},

	abstract = {Characterization of diel variability of fecal indicator bacteria concentration in nearshore waters is of particular importance for development of water sampling standards and protection of public health. Significant nighttime increase in Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration in beach water, previously observed at marine sites, has also been identified in summer 2000 from fixed locations in waist- and knee-deep waters at Chicago 63rd Street Beach, an embayed, tideless, freshwater beach with low currents at night (approximately 0.015 m s–1). A theoretical model using wave-induced mass transport velocity for advection was developed to assess the contribution of surface waves to the observed nighttime E. coli replenishment in the nearshore water. Using average wave conditions for the summer season of year 2000, the model predicted an amount of E. coli transported from water of intermediate depth, where sediment resuspension occurred intermittently, that would be sufficient to have elevated E. coli concentration in the surf and swash zones as observed. The nighttime replenishment of E. coli in the surf and swash zones revealed here is an important phase in the cycle of diel variations of E. coli concentration in nearshore water. According to previous findings in Ge et al. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2010, 44, 6731–6737), enhanced current circulation in the embayment during the day tends to displace and deposit material offshore, which partially sets up the system by the early evening for a new period of nighttime onshore movement. This wave-induced mass transport effect, although facilitating a significant base supply of material shoreward, can be perturbed or significantly influenced by high currents (orders of magnitude larger than a typical wave-induced mass transport velocity), current-induced turbulence, and tidal forcing.},
