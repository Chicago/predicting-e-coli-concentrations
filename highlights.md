  * Hybrid nowcast model allows for beach prediction based on current-day qPCR readings
  * Beaches in Chicago are selectively correlated, depending on features and location
  * Correlated beaches can be grouped with K-means to improve prediction accuracy
  * Hybrid nowcast model increases accuracy of predictions from 3.2% to 11.2% in 2017
  * Model allows limited qPCR equipment; reducing costs of qPCR deployment at beaches
