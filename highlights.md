  * Hybrid nowcast model allows for beach predictions to be based on current-day qPCR readings.
  * Beaches within Chicago are selectively correlated, depending on physical features and location.
  * Correlated beaches can be grouped with K-means and used to improve prediction accuracy.
  * Hybrid nowcast model increases the accuracy of predictions from 3.2% to 11.2% in 2017.
  * The model allows limited qPCR equipment; reducing costs of qPCR deployment at beaches.
